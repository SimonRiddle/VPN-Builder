# VPN Builder
This is a VPN builder for Cisco devices, inclusive of IOS, IOS-XE and ASA. This builder provides the configuration and supports only IKEv2 build configurations.

## How it works
These files take user input, which allow script users to completely decide the variables such as peer IP address. This will **not** however provide the full VPN configuration such as transport sets, as this is designed for new devices, to utilise existing VPN policies.
