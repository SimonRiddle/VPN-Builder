# VPN Builder
This is a VPN builder for Cisco devices, inclusive of IOS, IOS-XE and ASA. This builder provides the configuration and supports only IKEv2 build configurations.

## How it works
These files take user input, which allow script users to completely decide the variables such as peer IP address. 

### A word of warning
Although these scripts are tested, including the configuration; please do not blindly copy and paste the generated configuration. This is designed to give to give the user a good base of configuration to build off of and any network issues occured due to the script are not the responsibility of the repository owner.
